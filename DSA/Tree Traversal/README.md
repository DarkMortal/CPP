# Binary tree traversals using recursion
Note: destructors are only called for objects which are allocated memory statically, i.e, in the stack.

Objects allocated memory in heap needs to be freed explicitly either using:
- **delete**: if allocated using **new**
- **free()** if allocated using **malloc()**
